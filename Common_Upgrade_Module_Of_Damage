The sale of these modules is shunned, even outlawed in some areas. You normally don't need to make a flamethrower or antimatter cannon more deadly unless you want to destroy anyone that opposes you. Most sellers understand that there are androids, killers and bots that'll fight their customers as soon as they leave their store, so they don't mind their clients having a bit more firepower. Others find it pointless and won't allow them. Common Damage Modules may not give you that much bang for your bit buck but can mean the difference between life and death.
